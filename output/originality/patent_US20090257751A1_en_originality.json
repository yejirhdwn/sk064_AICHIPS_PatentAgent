      "title": "Hybrid electronic/optical switch system",
      "abstract": "A high speed optical communication and data transfer network comprises fiber optic links interconnecting a plurality of hybrid electronic-optical switch devices, each hybrid switch circuit including an electronic switch, electronic switch controller and optical switch. The hybrid switch circuits and nodes on the periphery of the core network communicate amongst each other over a first dedicated wavelength. Optical signals on the first dedicated wavelength are converted to electronic signals which are monitored by the electronic controller in each hybrid switch circuit. Routing in the network is optimized by transmitting lower volume data traffic on the first dedicated wavelength which is typically slower due to optical/electronic signal conversions and which uses more resources. Higher capacity data transfers are achieved by transmitting data on an assigned carrier wavelength over an established flow path among the optical switches of multiple hybrid switch circuits. Based on high and low volume data traffic, the method and apparatus discussed herein advantageously supports direct and indirect optical data transmissions with as few overall intermediate optical-to-electrical or electrical-to-optical conversions as possible.",

The WDM PON system provided a redundancy function to each node, so that the central office of the system can have a simplified architecture. Accordingly, there is an advantage in that the construction costs of the central office can be reduced. And, the network construction costs can be minimized because it is possible to provide a desired redundancy to a part of the nodes, taking into consideration the significance of each node.",

The wireless data access service is a point-to-multipoint cellular-type network that connects customers to data service providers through the ATM backbone of an existing network. Customers connect to the ATM backbone and data service provider through a cellular grid in which a wireless base station in each cell communicates with the individual customer wireless equipment within its cell site coverage area. The base stations are connected to an ATM backbone switch through wireless and wireline backhaul links. The upstream and downstream bandwidths of the wireless broadband network are engineered in various symmetric and asymmetric configurations to provide a shared packet-switched connection that emulates an uninterrupted, direct wireline ADSL connection. The wireless broadband network employs a data protocol of shared access bandwidth and adaptive asymmetric data rates to support multiuser service sessions by wireless transmission. The wireless broadband network is not network protocol specific and can be applied to wireless asymmetric digital subscriber line service, wireless integrated service digital network over digital subscriber line service, wireless very high bit rate digital subscriber line service, or wireless symmetric or single-line digital subscriber line service.",

      "abstract": "A wireless network has a plurality of base stations, each configured to communicate with at least one portable device using a WLAN protocol. The wireless network also has a VoIP core network coupled to each of the base stations. A WLAN mobile phone has a VoIP processor coupled to an RF section and configured to monitor a current signal strength from a current base station and an alternate signal strength from an alternate base station, wherein the VoIP processor is configured to disassociate from the current base station when an analysis of the current signal strength and the alternate signal strength indicate that it would be better to associate with the alternate base station. A method of handing-off a VoIP call-in-progress from a first base station to a second base station with reduced interruption in voice communication is also disclosed.",

      "abstract": "An apparatus and method transfers signals between a fiber network and a wireless network antenna. In a fiber to wireless stage, fiber signals are optically transferred from the fiber network and converted into RF signals compatible with the DOCSIS interface standard. The RF signals are electronically converted into data packets, the data packets are electronically converted into baseband digital signals, and the digital signals are converted into analog signals, before being transferred to the network antenna for wireless transmission. The data packets, digital signals, and analog signals are compatible with the IEEE 802.l6 wireless networking standard. Conversely, in a wireless to fiber stage, the analog signals are transferred from the antenna, and converted into digital signals, which are then electronically converted into data packets. The data packets are electronically converted into RF signals, which are next converted into fiber signals, before being optically transferred to the fiber network.",
