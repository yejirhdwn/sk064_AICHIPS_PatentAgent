In its most basic embodiment, the invention is a combustion system that includes three discrete units: a combustion unit, a carbon dioxide capture unit, and a sweep-based membrane separation unit. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is a power plant including a combustion unit, a power generation system, a carbon dioxide capture unit, and a sweep-based membrane separation unit. In both of these embodiments, the carbon dioxide capture unit and the sweep-based membrane separation unit are configured to be operated in parallel, by which we mean that each unit is adapted to receive exhaust gases from the combustion unit without such gases first passing through the other unit.",

The proposed process effects the separation of CO2 from a mixture of gases by its reaction with metal oxides. The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO2 (CaRS—CO2) process consists of contacting CO2 laden gas with CaO in a reactor such that CaO captures CO2 by the formation of CaCO3. CaCO3 is regenerated by calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO2. The “regenerated” CaO is then recycled for the further capture of CO2. This carbonation-calcination cycle forms the basis of the CaRS—CO2 process. This process also may use a mesoporous CaCO3 structure that attains >90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles.",

      "abstract": "Systems and methods are provided for combined cycle power generation while reducing or mitigating emissions during power generation. Recycled exhaust gas from a power generation combustion reaction can be separated using a swing adsorption process so as to generate a high purity CO2 stream while reducing/minimizing the energy required for the separation and without having to reduce the temperature of the exhaust gas. This can allow for improved energy recovery while also generating high purity streams of carbon dioxide and nitrogen.",

Exhaust gas from fossil fuel oxidation is scrubbed of CO2 via passage across a physical adsorbent and then released from the adsorbent via fuel oxidation waste heat. High CO2 concentration scrubber exhaust air is then compressed and fed to a diffuser which facilitates dissociation of the CO2 into water where it is temporarily stored for use in watering plants. Carbon from fossil fuel is recycled back into the environment and permanently stored as biomass by natural means of photosynthesis.",

The CO2 is captured by subjecting the CO2 gas feed stream to a temperature swing adsorption step. The temperature swing adsorption step comprises an adsorption step for producing a substantially dry carbon dioxide-depleted stream, and an adsorbent regeneration step comprising heating the adsorbent bed to produce a substantially water vapor-free carbon dioxide stream. Moisture from the gas stream containing CO2 is optionally removed by pressure swing adsorption, temperature swing adsorption, membrane separation, or absorption prior to CO2 capture.",

The oxyfuel combustor combusts hydrogen and carbon containing fuel with oxygen at a non-stoichiometric ratio, typically fuel rich. In such an operating mode, products of combustion include steam, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and hydrogen. These products of combustion are then passed through a hydrogen separator. Remaining products of combustion can be optionally combusted at a stoichiometric ratio with oxygen in a second oxyfuel combustor discharging substantially only steam and carbon dioxide. A turbine or other expander can be provided downstream from the gas generator to produce power and eliminate carbon monoxide from the system. The system can be operated in a second mode where the gas generator combusts the fuel with oxygen at a stoichiometric ratio to maximize electric power generation without hydrogen production at periods of peak power demand.",
