In the optical unit 100, the light emitting element mounting part 114 is positioned in the vicinity of a first focal point F1 of the first reflection face 132, a rear focal point F of the projection lens 150 is positioned in the vicinity of a second focal point F2 of the first reflection face 132, and a lamp longitudinal direction position of the first focal point F1 of the first reflection face 132 is located on the same position as the second focal point F2 or forward rather than the second focal point F2.",

The device further includes a means 105 for delaying the detection signal when the end is moved to the vehicle presence range side. A change in the light distribution is suppressed by the delay to eliminate that the operator feels annoyance.",

In a headlamp device capable of changing a light distribution pattern according to the presence of a front vehicle, the front vehicle is detected, and only the positions of the right and left front vehicles among a plurality of adjacent front vehicles are detected. Forward vehicle detection means 11 for estimating the front-end vehicle, and illumination area control means 12 for illuminating the front except for a series of light distribution areas from the position where the right-end front vehicle exists to the position where the left-end front vehicle exists. It is characterized by.  [Selection] Figure 3",
