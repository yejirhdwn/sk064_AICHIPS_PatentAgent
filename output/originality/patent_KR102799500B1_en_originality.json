The variables that are considered hereunder include, overall ‘reservations’, total current capacity, remaining capacity against unused reservations and penalties that apply for failing to satisfy ‘reservation’ commitments. The approach uses a rate of capacity consumption to calculate the risk of consuming the available capacity in each resource pool (e.g., resource pools allocated to satisfy different levels of service with different SLA failure penalties). Based on the relative available capacity in each pool (as determined by the pool rate of consumption), resources are reallocated to maximize revenue (e.g., reduce financial penalty) across a resource pool set.",

      "abstract": "Embodiments relate to management of hybrid workloads in a shared pool of configurable computer resources. Resource utilization in the shared pool is dynamically tracked, and employed for assessing a set of servers a parallel access protocol should utilize for one or more I/O requests in conjunction with any serial workload optimizations. Accordingly, the load balancing embodies a diverse set of workloads to support dynamic and equitable allocation.",

The new storage level order reduces a VM live state during a transition, and accounts for hierarchical shared storage memory and criteria imposed by an application to reduce recovery operations after dynamic resource allocation actions. The new storage level order recommendation is propagated to VMs. The new storage level order applied in the VMs. A different storage-level order is recommended after the transition.",

Participants lean towards a sound source to make it louder and lean away to make it quieter. In some embodiments, the more a participant leans, the faster the volume changes. Because the interactions were designed to respond to natural bearing and balancing instincts, movement coordination is intuitive and easy to learn.",
