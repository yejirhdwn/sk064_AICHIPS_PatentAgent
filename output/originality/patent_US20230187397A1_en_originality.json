      "title": "Phased antenna array module",
      "abstract": "A phased antenna array is disclosed. The phased antenna array is composed of one or more modules and has a plurality of antenna. The array has a plurality of antenna configured to operate as an array and each module has at least one antenna. The modules have a substrate that supports the antenna, a microelectronic device for sending signals to or receiving signals from said antenna and conductive traces that connect that antenna to the microelectronic device. In those embodiments where the phased antenna array has more than one module, a common substrate supports the one or more modules. A combination of circuitry and interconnects achieves the desired electrical interconnection between the modules.",
