Also provided is a pattern recognition system for a multimedia device, wherein a user input is matched to a video stream on a conceptual basis, allowing inexact programming of a multimedia device. The system analyzes a data stream for correspondence with a data pattern for processing and storage. The data stream is subjected to adaptive pattern recognition to extract features of interest to provide a highly compressed representation which may be efficiently processed to determine correspondence.

The first and second controllers each detect a target in images acquired from the respective first or second camera, calculate target information for the target, and transmit the target information to the server. The server generates list information including the target information from the first and second monitoring devices, and d transmits the list information to the first and second monitoring devices. The first controller further generates a map according to the list information received from the server, and displays the map on the first display.",

An event data pruner condenses or excludes certain event data. A cluster creator creates clusters from pruned and vectorized event data, using a clustering algorithm and a similarity metric, without any prior specification of the desired number of clusters. A cluster ranker ranks clusters according to event data volume and thread importance, thus prioritizing the event data for inspection. A results presenter configures a user interface to present ranked clusters, their associated data, data reduction statistics, regression analysis results, and other data reduction processing results. Thus, the innovative functionality assists analysis and prioritized inspection of event data by an analyst, surfacing organized event data that is relevant to the circumstance under investigation, or supporting comparison of clusters from before and after a change in the circumstance, or doing both.",
